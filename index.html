            <p class="content-tan">Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries
                from
                certain Coffea species. The genus Coffea is native to tropical Africa and Madagascar, the Comoros,
                Mauritius, and Réunion in the Indian Ocean.</p>

            <p class="content-tan">Coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial
                regions
                of the Americas, Southeast Asia, Indian subcontinent, and Africa. The two most commonly grown are C.
                arabica and C. robusta. Once ripe, coffee berries are picked, processed, and dried. Dried coffee seeds
                (referred to as "beans") are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans
                are ground and then brewed with near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as coffee.</p>

            <p class="content-tan">The word coffee appears to have derived from the name of the region where coffee
                beans were
                first used by a herder in the 6th or 9th centurykaffa (from the Keffa Zone in southwestern Ethiopia)
                derived from Kaffa Province, which was the name of the region in ancient Abyssinia.</p>

            <p class="content-tan"> The word "coffee" entered the English language in 1582 via the Dutch koffie,
                borrowed from
                the Ottoman Turkish kahve, borrowed in turn from the Arabic qahwah. The Arabic word qahwah was
                traditionally held to refer to a type of wine whose etymology is given by Arab lexicographers as
                deriving from the verb qahiya, "to lack hunger", in reference to the drink's reputation as an appetite
                suppressant. It has also been proposed that the source may be the Proto-Central Semitic root q-h-h
                meaning "dark".
                The term "coffee pot" dates from 1705. The expression "coffee break" was first attested in 1952. </p>

            <p class="content-tan">Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in
                humans,
                primarily due to its caffeine content. It is one of the most popular drinks in the world, and it can be
                prepared and presented in a variety of ways like espresso, French press, caffè latte. It is usually
                served hot, although iced coffee is a popular alternative</p>
