            <p class="content-brown">The history of coffee dates back to the 15th century, and possibly earlier with a number of
                reports and legends surrounding its first use. The native origin of coffee is thought to have been
                Ethiopia.The earliest substantiated evidence of either coffee drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree
                is
                from the early 15th century, in the Sufi monasteries of Yemen, spreading soon to Mecca and Cairo. By the
                16th century, it had reached the rest of the Middle East, South India , Persia, Turkey, the Horn of
                Africa,
                and northern Africa. Coffee then spread to the Balkans, Italy, and to the rest of Europe, as well as
                Southeast Asia and then to America, despite bans imposed during the 15th century by religious leaders in
                Mecca and Cairo, and later by the Catholic Church. </p>
